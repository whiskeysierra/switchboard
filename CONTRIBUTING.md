# Contributing

## Pull requests only

**DON'T** push to the master branch directly. Always use feature branches and let people discuss changes in pull requests.
Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been concluded and at least 1 reviewer has given their 
**approval**.

## Guidelines

- **every change** needs a test
- 100% code coverage
- keep the current code style
